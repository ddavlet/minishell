add an array of integers that count number of quotation opened - closed
all quotations must be 0 in the end. Can check it in the beggining
if not 0 int the end, stop

parsing starts with the most significant part:
1. Intead of returning empty string I can create empty istring
  in root of enviromental variables. Return this empty string pointer.
  use this pointer with static char and clean only at exit?
--find_var-- in --set_envvar--
2. I have to fix my counter function in split, if definatly
  counts wrong..

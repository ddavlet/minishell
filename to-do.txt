Have to fix:

1. check "test" command
2. Change wildcard $ is one more token


cases:

echo '"'read'"'

echo test1 |

echo test && (echo test 1 || echo test 2) | cat

| echo smth

multiple subshells opened

env | grep "LAST"

echo test && (echo test1 && echo test2 | cat) | cat


./test (permission restricted) - command failed to execute
$?

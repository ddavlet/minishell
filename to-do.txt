add an array of integers that count number of quotation opened - closed
all quotations must be 0 in the end. Can check it in the beggining
if not 0 int the end, stop

parsing starts with the most significant part:
1. need to set up the significance value for keys
2. go down by significance and changed input untill all levels passed
3. i.e. open up all brackets and modify brackets if needed,
  then get the value of some variable $VARIABLE and then go to operants
4. I can also store all level keys in array and search for them
5. use tokenazation for keys
6. chat-gpt "how bash reads input"
7. enumarator for commands and all tokens (since they are fixed)
